# Black Hole visualization

Equations used to create this visualization are available in the [eq.md](eq.md) file.

## Geodesics

## TODO

- [x] Write the correct equations to solve 
- [x] Solve system to find geodesics on a plane arround a black hole
- [ ] Visualize black hole with fixed background
- [ ] Add acretion disk
- [ ] Incorporate light intensity variation due to the lenght of its path
- [ ] Take into account the angular velocity of the black hole (kerr black hole)
